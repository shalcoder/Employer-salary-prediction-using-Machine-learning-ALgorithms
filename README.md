A comprehensive machine learning system that predicts AI/ML/Data Science salaries based on job characteristics, experience level, location, and company details. Built with Python, scikit-learn, and deployed using Streamlit.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project analyzes global AI/ML salary data to build predictive models that help:
- **Job seekers** benchmark realistic salary expectations
- **Recruiters** make data-driven compensation decisions
- **Companies** ensure competitive and fair pay structures
- **Career planners** understand salary progression trends

### üèÜ Key Features

- **Multi-feature prediction** using job title, experience, location, company size, and remote work ratio
- **Interactive web application** with real-time salary predictions
- **Comprehensive data analysis** with visualizations and market insights
- **Global coverage** across 100+ countries and 200+ job titles
- **Model comparison** between Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the **AI/ML/Data Science Salary Dataset** from [aijobs.net](https://aijobs.net/salaries/download/), which includes:

- **15,000+ salary records** (2020-2024)
- **200+ unique job titles** in AI/ML/Data Science
- **100+ countries** represented
- **Multiple features**: experience level, employment type, company size, remote work ratio

### Dataset Features:
- `work_year`: Year of employment
- `experience_level`: EN (Entry), MI (Mid), SE (Senior), EX (Executive)
- `employment_type`: FT (Full-time), PT (Part-time), CT (Contract), FL (Freelance)
- `job_title`: Specific role (e.g., Data Scientist, ML Engineer)
- `salary_in_usd`: Annual salary in USD
- `employee_residence`: Country of employee
- `remote_ratio`: 0 (On-site), 50 (Hybrid), 100 (Remote)
- `company_location`: Country of company headquarters
- `company_size`: S (Small), M (Medium), L (Large)
